# BTCDecoded Governance System - DISCLAIMER

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING

**This governance system is currently UNRELEASED and UNTESTED in production.**

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Building (Current)
- ‚úÖ **Core Infrastructure**: All major components implemented
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Complete with migrations
- ‚úÖ **Economic Node System**: Registry and veto mechanism
- ‚úÖ **Governance Fork**: Export and adoption tracking
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Integration**: Status checks and merge blocking
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT ACTIVATED**: Governance rules are not enforced
- üîß **Test Keys Only**: No real cryptographic enforcement

### What This Means

1. **Production Quality Code**: The codebase is well-structured and production-quality
2. **Not Battle-Tested**: Has not been tested in real-world production scenarios
3. **Rapid Development**: System is in active AI-assisted development
4. **Expect Changes**: APIs, interfaces, and behavior may change frequently
5. **Use at Your Own Risk**: This is experimental software

## Timeline

### Phase 2: Governance Activation (3-6 months)
- Real cryptographic keys and enforcement
- Production deployment guidelines
- Security audit and testing
- Community validation and feedback

### Phase 3: Full Operation (12+ months)
- Mature, stable system
- Battle-tested in production
- Full documentation and support
- Community adoption

## Current Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- **Test Keys Only**: All cryptographic operations use test keys
- **No Real Enforcement**: Governance rules are not actually enforced
- **Development Environment**: Designed for testing and development
- **Frequent Updates**: Breaking changes may occur

### Security Considerations
- **Not Audited**: Code has not undergone security audit
- **Experimental**: New cryptographic governance model
- **Untested**: Not tested in adversarial conditions
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: No warranty or guarantee

## For Different Audiences

### Developers
- **Safe to Experiment**: Test environment is safe for development
- **Follow Guidelines**: Use test keys and development configurations
- **Report Issues**: Help improve the system through feedback
- **Contribute**: Welcome to contribute to the codebase

### Organizations
- **Do Not Deploy**: Do not use in production environments
- **Monitor Progress**: Follow development and updates
- **Provide Feedback**: Your input shapes the final system
- **Wait for Phase 2**: Deploy only after official release

### Researchers
- **Study the Code**: Codebase is open for research and analysis
- **Understand the Model**: New approach to Bitcoin governance
- **Provide Analysis**: Academic and technical analysis welcome
- **Collaborate**: Work with the development team

## What's Working

### Infrastructure Components
- ‚úÖ Economic node registry and qualification system
- ‚úÖ Veto signal collection and threshold calculation
- ‚úÖ Governance configuration export and versioning
- ‚úÖ GitHub status check integration
- ‚úÖ Merge blocking and enforcement logic
