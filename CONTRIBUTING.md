## Development Standards

### Code Style

- Follow Rust conventions and idioms
- Use `cargo fmt` to format code
- Use `cargo clippy` to check for improvements

- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Add integration tests for complex features
- Aim for high test coverage

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Update README files when adding features
- Include code examples in documentation
- Follow Rust documentation conventions

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:

## Repository-Specific Guidelines

### consensus-proof

- **Exact Version Pinning**: All consensus-critical dependencies must be pinned to exact versions
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Changes must maintain mathematical correctness
- **Pure Functions**: All functions must remain side-effect-free
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All mathematical functions must be thoroughly tested

### protocol-engine

- **Protocol Abstraction**: Changes must maintain clean abstraction
- **Variant Support**: Ensure all Bitcoin variants continue to work
- **Backward Compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes to protocol interfaces

### reference-node

- **Consensus Integrity**: Never modify consensus rules
- **Production Readiness**: Consider production deployment implications
- **Performance**: Maintain reasonable performance characteristics
