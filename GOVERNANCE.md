# BTCDecoded Governance

## Overview

BTCDecoded is governed by a transparent, community-driven process that balances technical excellence with community input. This document outlines our governance model, decision-making processes, and community structure.

## Governance Principles

1. **Technical Excellence**: Decisions prioritize mathematical accuracy and consensus correctness
2. **Community Input**: Open discussion and feedback from the community
3. **Transparency**: All decisions and processes are public and documented
4. **Meritocracy**: Contributions and expertise drive influence
5. **Consensus Building**: Decisions are made through discussion and consensus

## Project Structure

### Core Maintainers

Core maintainers are responsible for:
- Technical direction and architecture decisions
- Code review and quality assurance
- Release management and versioning
- Security response and vulnerability management

### Community Contributors

Community contributors include:
- Code contributors
- Documentation writers
- Test writers
- Bug reporters
- Feature requesters

## Decision-Making Process

### Technical Decisions

1. **Proposal**: Technical proposals are made via GitHub issues or discussions
2. **Discussion**: Open discussion period (minimum 1 week)
3. **Review**: Technical review by maintainers
4. **Decision**: Decision made by consensus of maintainers
5. **Implementation**: Implementation by contributors
6. **Review**: Code review and testing
7. **Merge**: Merge after approval

### Consensus Rule Changes

Consensus rule changes require:
- **Mathematical justification**: Must be based on Orange Paper or peer-reviewed research
- **Community consensus**: Broad community agreement
- **Security review**: Independent security review
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across all variants

### Protocol Evolution

Protocol evolution decisions:
- **Backward compatibility**: Must maintain backward compatibility
- **Variant support**: Must work across all supported variants
- **Documentation**: Must be thoroughly documented
- **Migration path**: Clear migration path for users

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **Major**: Breaking changes to consensus rules
- **Minor**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Release Schedule

- **Patch releases**: As needed for security fixes
- **Minor releases**: Quarterly for new features
- **Major releases**: Annual for significant changes

### Release Criteria

- All tests pass
- Security review completed
- Documentation updated
- Migration guide provided (if needed)
