# BTCDecoded Organization

Welcome to the BTCDecoded GitHub organization, home to the Bitcoin Commons project - the next generation of Bitcoin governance infrastructure built on the BLLVM technology stack.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This governance system is currently UNRELEASED and UNTESTED in production.**

### Current Status: Phase 1 (Infrastructure Building)

- ✅ **Infrastructure Complete**: All core components implemented
- ⚠️ **Not Yet Activated**: Governance rules are not enforced
- 🔧 **Test Keys Only**: No real cryptographic enforcement
- 📋 **Development Phase**: System is in rapid AI-assisted development

### What This Means

- **Production Quality**: The codebase is production-quality in many respects
- **Not Battle-Tested**: Has not been tested in real-world scenarios
- **Expect Changes**: Rapid development means frequent updates
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: This is experimental software

### Timeline

- **Phase 2 Activation**: 3-6 months (governance enforcement begins)
- **Phase 3 Full Operation**: 12+ months (mature, stable system)
- **Current Phase**: Infrastructure building and testing

### For Developers

If you're working on this system:

1. **Test Environment Only**: Never use production keys
2. **Expect Breaking Changes**: APIs and interfaces may change
3. **Follow Development Guidelines**: See individual repository READMEs
4. **Report Issues**: Use GitHub issues for bugs and feature requests

### For Organizations Considering Adoption

- **Wait for Phase 2**: Do not deploy in production yet
- **Monitor Development**: Follow our progress and updates
- **Provide Feedback**: Your input shapes the final system
- **Stay Informed**: Subscribe to updates and announcements

## Repositories

### Core Infrastructure
- [`governance-app`](../governance-app/) - GitHub App for governance enforcement
- [`bllvm-sdk`](../developer-sdk/) - Cryptographic primitives and CLI tools (package: bllvm-sdk, directory: developer-sdk/)
- [`governance`](../governance/) - Governance configuration and documentation

### Documentation
- [`governance-system-review.plan.md`](../governance-system-review.plan.md) - Development roadmap
- [`governance/GOVERNANCE.md`](../governance/GOVERNANCE.md) - Governance process documentation

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Documentation**: Start with the governance documentation
2. **Understand the System**: Review the architecture and design
3. **Follow Development**: Monitor progress and updates
4. **Wait for Phase 2**: Do not deploy until officially released

## Support

- **Issues**: Use GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub discussions for questions and feedback
- **Security**: Report security issues privately to maintainers
